    "1. In the below elements which of them are values or an expression? eg:- values can be integer or string and expressions will be mathematical operators.\n",
    "* \n",
    "'hello'\n",
    "-87.8\n",
    "- \n",
    "/ \n",
    "+\t\n",
    "6 \n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: Values are ‘hello’, -87.8,6  Expressions are *,-,/ and +.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. What is the difference between string and variable?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: String is a data type which is enclosed in “”. Ex: “My name is xyz”\n",
    "Variable is the one in which we store the data. Ex: a= \"My name is xyz”.\n",
    "We can store a string inside a variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Describe three different data types.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: String : String is a data type which is enclosed in “”. Ex: “My name is xyz”\n",
    "String data type is indicated as “Str” in python. We can typecast a integer or float into str using str()\n",
    "Int : Int is a numerical data type which consists of all the positive and negative integers. We can typecast a float into int using int()\n",
    " Ex: “45”, “105”, “-12”\n",
    "Float: Float is a numerical data type which consists of floating point numbers. We can typecast a int into float using float()\n",
    "Ex : “45.666”, “-56.455”\n",
    "Boolean: Boolean is the data type which consists of True and False. They are used for decision making. The value of True is 1 and False is 0.\n",
    "Ex: True, False\n",
    "\n",
    "4. What is an expression made up of? What do all expressions do?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: Expressions are made up of mathematical operators. Some of the different expressions are “+”, “-“, “/” and “*”. Expressions are used for evluating the statements and for performing mathematical and decision making things.\n",
    "Addition expression is used to append a string or add one numerical value to other.\n",
    "Subtraction expression is used to subtract a numerical value from other.\n",
    "Division expression is used to divide a numerical value with other.\n",
    "Multiplication expression is used to Multiply the numerical values and also to get repeated strings.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. This assignment statements, like spam = 10. What is the difference between an expression and a statement?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: Expressions are the one’s made of operators like arithmetic and Boolean. They work with values and strings using operators. Statements are the lines of codes in python. Expression can also be a statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. After running the following code, what does the variable bacon contain?\n",
    "bacon = 22\n",
    "bacon + 1\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: 23\n",
    "\n",
    "7. What should the values of the following two terms be?\n",
    "'spam' + 'spamspam'\n",
    "'spam' * 3\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:‘spamspamspam’\n",
    "‘spamspamspam'\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Why is eggs a valid variable name while 100 is invalid?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: A variable name can not be started with numerical values. That’s the reason eggs is a valid variable name while 100 is invalid\n",
    "\n",
    "9. What three functions can be used to get the integer, floating-point number, or string version of a value?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: int()\n",
    "float()\n",
    "str()\n",
    "\n",
    "10. Why does this expression cause an error? How can you fix it?\n",
    "'I have eaten ' + 99 + ' burritos.'\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: Addition operators will not work with different data types as there are string and int data types in the above statement it causes an error. We can fix it by converting 99 into string by keeping it as “99” instead if 99.\n"
